A project completed on Codecademy using React and the Spotify API. This app allows a user to add songs to a custom playlist and add this playlist to their
Spotify profile. The different React components are saved within the 'src' folder.

Unfortunetly this app wasn't working while hosted on Github Pages, so I have just uploaded the main files for this project.
